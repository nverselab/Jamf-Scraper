IBM Privacy Statement\

\b0\fs28 At IBM we value your privacy and are committed to protecting and processing your personal information responsibly.\
This privacy statement describes how IBM collects, uses and shares your information. It applies to IBM Corporation and IBM subsidiaries except where a subsidiary presents its own statement without reference to IBM\'92s.\
We may provide additional data privacy information by using a supplementary privacy notice.\
\

\b\fs36 Personal Information We Collect and Use\

\fs28 \

\b0 This section describes the various types of information that we collect and how we use it.\
\

\b Your Account
\b0 \
You can create an account with IBM by creating an IBMid. An IBMid provides IBM with your name, email address, and country or region of residence. We may require an IBMid for certain services, such as the use of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.ibm.com/privacy#IBM_Cloud_and_Online_Services"}}{\fldrslt IBM Cloud and Online Services}} (https://www.ibm.com/privacy#IBM_Cloud_and_Online_Services).\
We may also store your details from business contact information that you provide to us, or that we collect from your organization, our Business Partners, or our suppliers.\
An IBMid uniquely identifies you when you access our websites, make a request or order, or use a product or service. If you log into our websites with an IBMid we may link the information we collect with your account. An IBMid is also used to give you access to IBM Cloud and Online Services and allows you to manage your contract and billing history. The email address in your IBMid may be used to contact you in relation to any services to which you subscribe.\
Business contact information is typically information that you would find on a business card, such as name and business contact details. We use this information to contact or communicate with you about business matters. If we receive business contact information from a third party, such as an IBM Business Partner or supplier, we will confirm that the information was shared appropriately.\
We may also combine your business contact information with other business-relevant information, such as information about your professional education, skills, work experience, or other publicly available information, such as business-related blogs, publications, job roles, and certifications. This information may be used to tailor our interactions with you in any part of IBM\'92s business, for example in the sales process, to maintain a relationship with you, and for post-contractual relationships.\
\

\b IBM Websites
\b0 \
Our websites offer ways to communicate with you about us, our products, and services.

To review or set your preferences regarding the information that we collect about you on our websites select Cookie Preferences in the website footer.\
We use contact information that we collect directly from you, your organization, or third-party data providers, to communicate with you about our products, services, and offerings. When we obtain information about you indirectly from third parties, we implement checks and controls to confirm that this information was legally acquired by the third party and that the third party has the right to provide the information to us for our use in marketing.\
We may, subject to your preferences, collect information about your interactions with {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.ibm.com/privacy#Our_Websites"}}{\fldrslt our websites}} (https://www.ibm.com/privacy#Our_Websites), our emails (such as whether emails are opened or links selected), and other IBM content, including content on third-party sites.

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 Contractual Relationships
\b0 \
A contractual relationship is created when you order a trial, or a product or service from us. While we mainly provide our products and services to businesses, individuals may also enter into an agreement with us directly as a client. We may collect any information that is reasonably necessary to prepare for, enter, and fulfill, the contractual agreement.\
The information collected in a contractual relationship may include the business contact information of the requester, an IBMid, and the order details. Information that is required for shipment and payment, for the implementation of services, or to grant access to the product or service may also be collected.\
This information may be collected for various purposes, depending on the nature of the products or services, for example, for contractual management and compliance, to provide support, for the improvement or development of our products and services, to contact you for customer satisfaction surveys, and to generate technical and market insights. For more information, see {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.ibm.com/privacy#IBM_Cloud_and_Online_Services"}}{\fldrslt IBM Cloud and Online Services}} (https://www.ibm.com/privacy#IBM_Cloud_and_Online_Services).\
\pard\tx566\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \

\b Support Services
\b0 \
When you contact us to request support, we collect your contact information, problem description, and possible resolutions. We record the information that is provided to handle the support query, for administrative purposes, to foster our relationship with you, for staff training, and for quality assurance purposes.\
The information that we collect may include any information exchanged during our phone conversations or provided during Live Chat support sessions on our websites. We may use this information to inform you of products or services that are related to your support request. This can include product updates or fixes, and we may combine the information that is collected through other interactions with you or your organization to provide more valuable suggestions in relation to product support, such as any available training regarding the issue.\
While we handle the support case, we may have incidental access to information that you have provided or information that is on your system. This information may contain information about you, your organization's employees, customers, or other relevant parties. The conditions regarding the handling and processing of this information is covered by the applicable Terms of Use or other agreements between your organization and IBM, such as the Terms of Use for Exchanging Diagnostic Data.\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 Protecting You and IBM
\b0 \
We may collect and use information to protect you and IBM from IT security threats and to secure the information that we hold from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. This includes information from our IT access authorization systems, such as log-in information.\
The security solutions we use to protect your information, our infrastructure, and our networks may collect information such as IP addresses and log files. This is necessary for the functionality and utility of security programs to enable the investigation of any potential security incidents and generate insights on security threats.\
We may use specialized tooling and other technical means to collect information at access points to, and in, IT systems and networks to detect unauthorized access, viruses, and indications of malicious activities. The information we collect may be used to conduct investigations when unauthorized access, malware or malicious activities are suspected, and to remove or isolate malicious code or content.\
\pard\tx566\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \

\b IBM Locations
\b0 \
When you visit an IBM location, we collect your name or business contact information (see {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.ibm.com/privacy#Your_Account"}}{\fldrslt Your Account}} (https://www.ibm.com/privacy#Your_Account)), and, in some cases, information from a government issued ID. This information is collected for access management and to protect the security and safety of our locations and employees.\
The information that is collected at our locations is used to issue access badges. We may verify the identity of visitors where legally permissible and, for supplier personnel working on site, a badge with a photo identification may be requested for identification purposes.\
Camera supervision and access management are used for reasons of security and safety of our locations, employees, and assets. More information may be available at the IBM location.\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 Recruitment and Former Employees
\b0 \
We are constantly searching for new talent for our organization, and we collect information about job applicants or prospective candidates from several sources. Applicants are referred to the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.ibm.com/employment/talent_acquisition_privacy.html"}}{\fldrslt Talent Acquisition Privacy Notice}} (https://www.ibm.com/employment/talent_acquisition_privacy.html) for more information. When an employee leaves IBM, we continue to process information that is related to them for any remaining business, contractual, employment, legal, and fiscal purposes, including the management of pensions to the extent handled by IBM.\
Regarding recruitment, we may look for prospective candidates with the help of recruitment intermediaries and may use publicly available information on social media platforms to identify prospective candidates for a specific function.\
When an employee leaves IBM, we retain basic information from the former employee about their employment at IBM.\
After an employee retires, we process information about the retiree for fulfilling the pension obligations toward the retiree. Information about the processing of pension information, or other retirement programs, can be found with the local organization responsible for pensions. In some countries, this may be an independent organization. In some cases, retirees may still participate in IBM-organized initiatives or programs, such as volunteer and social responsibility programs. Such participation is voluntary, and more information is provided on the relevant websites or information pages for those initiatives.\
\pard\tx566\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \

\b Conducting our Business Operations
\b0 \
We collect and use information to improve our business operations, systems, and processes. For example, information may be used to conduct, maintain, audit, and optimize our operations, to protect our assets and employees, for product development, and to defend our rights.\
We collect information about our business operations to make informed decisions about the organization, the business, and to report on performance, audits, and trends. For example, we use this information to analyze the costs and quality of our operations. Where possible, this is done by using aggregated information, but it may use personal information.\
We collect and use information from our business systems, which may include personal information, to:\

When you visit our websites, cloud and online services, software products, or view our content on certain third-party websites, we collect information regarding your connection by using various online tracking technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, Local Storage, or HTML5. Information that is collected with these technologies may be necessary to operate the website or service, to improve performance, to help us understand how our online services are used, or to determine the interests of our users. We use advertising partners to provide and assist in the use of such technologies on IBM and other sites.\
A cookie is a piece of data that a website may send to your browser, which may be stored on your computer and can be used to identify your computer. Web beacons, including pixels and tags, are technologies that are used to track a user visiting an IBM web page or if a web page was copied to another website. Web beacons may be used in email messages or newsletters to determine whether messages are read, forwarded, or links selected. Local Shared Objects can store content information displayed on the webpage visited, and preferences. These may be used to provide connected features across our websites or display targeted IBM advertising on other websites based on your interests.   \
Session cookies can be used to track your progression from page to page so that you are not asked for information that you have already provided during the current session, or information that is needed to be able to complete a transaction. Session cookies are erased when the web browser is closed.

\b\fs36 \cf2 How We Share Personal Information
\b0\fs28 \
When sharing personal information, we implement appropriate checks and controls to confirm that the information can be shared.\
If we decide to sell, buy, merge, or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries, such a transaction may involve disclosing some personal information to prospective or actual business purchasers, or the collection of personal information from those selling such businesses.\
Internally, personal information is shared for our legitimate business purposes, such as managing our relationship with you and other external parties, compliance programs, or systems and networks security. We do this to improve efficiency, for cost savings, and internal collaboration between our subsidiaries. Our internal access to personal information is restricted and granted only on a need-to-know basis. Sharing of this information is subject to the appropriate intracompany arrangements, our policies, and security standards.\

\b\fs36 \cf2 Controller and Representative Information
\b0\fs28 \
IBM does business through its subsidiaries worldwide. The privacy laws in some countries consider a Controller to be the legal entity (or natural person) who defines the purposes for which the processing of personal information takes place and how that information is processed. Parties that are involved in processing operations on behalf of a Controller may be designated as Processors. Designations and associated obligations differ, depending on the jurisdiction.\
Where this is relevant for the privacy laws in your country, the Controller of your personal information is IBM\'92s main subsidiary in your country or region, unless International Business Machines Corporation (IBM Corp.) or another IBM subsidiary identifies itself as the Controller for a specific interaction with you.\
The contact details of our main subsidiary of a country or region can be found by selecting your country or region and selecting Contact on the footer of ibm.com websites. IBM Corp. can be contacted at: International Business Machines Corporation, 1, North Castle Drive, Armonk, New York, United States of America.\

We also require our Business Partners, suppliers, and third parties to implement appropriate safeguards, such as contract terms and access restrictions, to protect information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure. \
We only retain personal information as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it is processed, or to comply with legal and regulatory retention requirements. Legal and regulatory retention requirements may include retaining information for:\
