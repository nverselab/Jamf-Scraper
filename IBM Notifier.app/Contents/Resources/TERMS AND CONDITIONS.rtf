Items for Which IBM May Be Liable
\f1\b0 \uc0\u8232 Circumstances may arise where, because of a default on IBM's part or other liability, you are entitled to recover damages from IBM.

If there is no charge for the App, the maximum liability is $50 US. This limit also applies to any of IBM's App developers, distributors and suppliers. It is the maximum for which IBM, its App developers, distributors and suppliers are collectively responsible.
